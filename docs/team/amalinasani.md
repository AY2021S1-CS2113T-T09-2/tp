## Project: ra.VI
### Overview
Repository assistant with a Versatile Interface (ra.VI) is a desktop app for managing tasks, deadlines, and notes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).  
If you can type fast, ra.VI can manage your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
ra.VI helps you to manage your tasks, and their corresponding deadlines with ease. It can also help you plan your timetable and being organised keeps you ahead of the curve.

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Features
* **List Command**: Added the ability to list all added tasks and modules in ra.VI.
  * What it does: allows the user to view the list of tasks or modules. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **Done Command**: Added the ability to list all added tasks and modules in ra.VI.
